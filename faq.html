            Do you repair jukeboxes?
          </h5>
          <p>
            We would be happy to help anyone with a jukebox question or problem, either in-house or by referring you to someone with a different area of expertise.

            How good is the sound? Can I try a jukebox before renting?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Because of its tube amplifier and five speakers, the Seeburg HF100R is generally considered one of the best sounding jukes ever made.
            <br>It was designed to fill a busy room with sound.  It cannot compete with a modern state of the art sound system for power or clarity.  The best way to hear what it sounds like is to come to the shop!

          <h5>
            What if I want to rent a different model jukebox?
          </h5>
          <p>
            At this time, New York Jukebox offers only the Seeburg HF100R.  Other jukeboxes have their charms, but none sound better.  For more detail, see the 1954 Seeburg page.

            What do you mean by “disabling malfunction”?
          </h5>
          <p>
            A disabling malfunction is anything that makes the whole jukebox unusable.  A problem with particular selections-- a record that has a skip or scratch, for example—is not disabling.  A problem with the lighting is not disabling, but the failure of the motor or amplifier is.  Every jukebox has been tested extensively in the shop, often with the records you selected, and tested again on site.

          <h5>
            What if I want to use my own records?
          </h5>
          <p>
            You are welcome to supply your own records, which New York Jukebox will install for no additional charge.  However, you will need to supply us with information for title strips in advance, and have the records prepared before the jukebox is delivered.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h5>
            What if I want to buy a jukebox or rent one for a longer period?
          </h5>
          <p>
            We would be happy to sell or lease a jukebox.  Call or email if you are interested.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            Can I hook up the jukebox to my own sound system?  Can the jukebox play music from a computer or cd player.
          </h5>
          <p>
            Neither is impossible; neither is recommended.
