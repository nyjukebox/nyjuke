      <p>New York Jukebox was founded in 2016 by Terry Swords, ten years after his wife gave him a jukebox.  Terry learned to read by studying record labels, or so he has been told.  His earliest career ambition was to be a disk jockey.  He remembers exactly which 45s he had in the blue vinyl record box he got for Christmas in the early 70s, and which record would not play in the jukebox of a bar his father brought him to in the Virgin Islands, only a few years later.</p>
      <p>He had served in New York City’s public schools as a teacher and administrator for nearly 20 years, completing his career as an educator in Sudan with his family. The two barky dogs sometimes found in the shop are from there.  Since then, Terry’s been absorbed by jukebox technicians’ manuals, electronics textbooks, back issues of trade magazines, and hobbyists’ handbooks.  He is grateful to the wise elders who tended jukeboxes when they were the cornerstone of the music industry, many of whom are very generous with their time and knowledge.</p>
